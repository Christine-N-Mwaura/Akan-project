Story: Discover your Akan name.

If interested in knowing your Akhan name
In order to do so:
First type in your year of birth,the month and the day.

Scenario 1: The date fields are correctly typed in.
Then we can proceed to select the gender.
When they are both selected then we can click the submit button.
Then your Akaan name can be displayed with a alert of the name.

Scenario 2: The date is not typed in correctly .
Given that a month is greater than 12 or 0 and below,or the day selected is greater than 31 or o and below,
Then we cannot proceed to select the gender.
Since the submit button will disable if not selected.
The incorrectly input fields will display an error message and you will have to correctly input those fields.
