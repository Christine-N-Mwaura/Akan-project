        <h3>What does this application do?</h3>
        <p>
          The Akan people are a historically important ethnic group of West Africa.
          With over 20 million members the Akans are one of the biggest Ethnic groups in West Africa today.
          Also they have an interesting culture of naming their children depending on the day they were born.
          They have male and female names for each day. This application allows you to input your birthday then depending on the day you were born and your gender, you get your Akan name.
